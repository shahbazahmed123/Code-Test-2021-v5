Your thoughts about the code. 

#What makes it amazing code Or what makes it ok code.

Application folder file structure and Comments are ok

#what makes it terrible code.

Code is messy

All scenarios of condition statement(s) not covered that may throw error.

Laravel Validation not used. it should be used to code less and provide more readiblity and flexibilty

Furthermore there should be intermediate layer service class (JobService) which should proccess logic part of application
So process workflow should be
JobController ==> JobService ==> JobRepository
 
JobController (Handle controls data flow between view & service) 
JobService (Handle business logic and communicate with repository for data saving/retrieving)
JobRepository (Acts as abstraction layer for operations between application data (Models) and database (Tables))

#Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic..

Controller and Reposiroty name is not semantic
it should be JobController and JobRepository

More details should be added on comments

Localization should be added if app support multi language or in fututre it may be needed.
